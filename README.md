4 different Health Datasets with ensemble models

This dissertation focuses on the diagnosis of chronic diseases with a particular emphasis on breast cancer, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and heart disease, the study investigates the possibility of advanced computational strategies to improve health prognoses by using the power of machine learning. The study studies the efficacy of various machine learning models and pre-processing methods by analyzing distinct datasets connected with these disorders. The study of the results gives interesting insights into the accuracy of chronic disease prediction. Among the models tested the Random Forest algorithm emerges as one of the most accurate, outperforming competitors such as k- nearest neighbours and AdaBoost. Furthermore, when tested using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, Random Forest performs well, confirming its effectiveness in health prediction. Using the data this study emphasises the importance of incorporating machine learning approaches in forecasting chronic illnesses. The review of various datasets, including the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset, the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, the Heart Disease Dataset and the MRI & Alzheimer's Dataset highlights the need of applying customised machine learning algorithms based on extensive evaluation metric and additionally the study highlights the potential of ensemble approaches to improve prediction accuracy by combining the capabilities of many classifiers.

Breast Cancer
Breast cancer is a prevalent health issue worldwide that affects both men and women. With reference to the World Health Organization (WHO), breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases reported in 2020 alone (WHO, 2021). In the UK, breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, with approximately 55,000 new cases diagnosed each year (Cancer Research UK, 2021). Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for improved treatment outcomes and patient survival and for this reason several diagnostic methods have been developed to detect breast cancer early, including mammography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recently, machine learning (ML) algorithms have been used in combination with medical imaging to improve the accuracy of breast cancer detection and diagnosis (Adegun et al., 2021).


Diabetes
Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that affects the body's ability to process blood sugar. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), approximately 463 million adults aged 20-79 years were living with diabetes globally in 2019, with this number projected to increase further to 700 million by 2045 (IDF, 2021). In the UK, diabetes affects approximately 3.9 million people, with approximately 90% of these cases being type 2 diabetes (Diabetes UK, 2021). Early detection and management of diabetes are fundamental for preventing long-term complications, such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, and blindness. Machine learning techniques have been utilized to predict the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by analysing various risk factors, such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and blood pressure (Deng et al., 2021).


MRI & Alzheimer's
Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behaviour. According to the Alzheimer's Association, approximately 6.2 million Americans aged 65 and older are diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2021, with this number projected to increase to 12.7 million by 2050, denoting a overall 104.8% increase in the number of Alzheimer cases, (Alzheimer's Association, 2021). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging technique that can be used to detect structural changes in the brain that are associated with Alzheimer's disease. Machine learning algorithms have been used to analyse MRI images to predict the onset of Alzheimer's disease in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (Basaia et al., 2021).


Heart Disease
 Heart disease is a broad term that encompasses several conditions that affect the heart and blood
vessels, including coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure, and arrhythmias. According to the American Heart Association, heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths in 2019 (American Heart Association, 2021). Early detection of heart disease is critical for improving outcomes, reducing complications. And with the assistance of machine learning techniques, it can reveal early indications of developing heart disease by analysing various risk factors, such as age, sex, smoking status, and blood pressure (Krittanawong et al., 2021).

In conclusion, this dissertation emphasises the critical significance of machine learning in improving the accuracy of chronic disease diagnosis as the study contributes to the field of disease prediction by analysing a variety of machine learning models and taking into account ensemble methodologies presenting to us that further study should be conducted to investigate the underlying principles of ensemble approaches and optimise their application in specific healthcare contexts, with the goal of developing more accurate and efficient diagnostic tools.
