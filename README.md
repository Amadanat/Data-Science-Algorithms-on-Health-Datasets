4 different Health Datasets with ensemble models

This dissertation focuses on the diagnosis of chronic diseases with a particular emphasis on breast cancer, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and heart disease, the study investigates the possibility of advanced computational strategies to improve health prognoses by using the power of machine learning. The study studies the efficacy of various machine learning models and pre-processing methods by analyzing distinct datasets connected with these disorders. The study of the results gives interesting insights into the accuracy of chronic disease prediction. Among the models tested the Random Forest algorithm emerges as one of the most accurate, outperforming competitors such as k- nearest neighbours and AdaBoost. Furthermore, when tested using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, Random Forest performs well, confirming its effectiveness in health prediction. Using the data this study emphasises the importance of incorporating machine learning approaches in forecasting chronic illnesses. The review of various datasets, including the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset, the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, the Heart Disease Dataset and the MRI & Alzheimer's Dataset highlights the need of applying customised machine learning algorithms based on extensive evaluation metric and additionally the study highlights the potential of ensemble approaches to improve prediction accuracy by combining the capabilities of many classifiers.

In conclusion, this dissertation emphasises the critical significance of machine learning in improving the accuracy of chronic disease diagnosis as the study contributes to the field of disease prediction by analysing a variety of machine learning models and taking into account ensemble methodologies presenting to us that further study should be conducted to investigate the underlying principles of ensemble approaches and optimise their application in specific healthcare contexts, with the goal of developing more accurate and efficient diagnostic tools.
